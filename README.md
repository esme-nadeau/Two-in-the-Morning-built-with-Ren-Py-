Two in the Morning is a short demo of a point-and-click adventure-style game programmed using the Renpy engine. It was developed, written, and illustrated by me. 

The main folder of this repository, Two in the Morning, contains all base files and assets of the game. 

To play the game yourself, you can download the zipped file for your machine in the "TwointheMorning DISTRIBUTIONS" folder, and access the executable from there.
